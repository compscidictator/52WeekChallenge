We wandered around the old stone mines for half an hour before we 
finally found the actual Catacombs, and a further 15 minutes after 
that before we found the chamber where the event was being held. As 
we finally approached the music my flash-light was no longer the 
only source of light. Instead the reds, greens and blues of the 
party strobe played across the empty nose and endless stares of so 
many skulls. We were only saved from their grim smiles by the fact 
that most of the jaws had been removed and stored separately.

It had been Angelo's idea to have the party here. Ever the host, he 
made every one of his events more scandalous and thus of course 
desirable than the last. "Where shall we who can go where others 
can't have a party? Where NOONE can go." It was true that no one had 
been allowed into the tunnels since that child had gotten lost while 
doing a dare and starved to death some years ago, but 'allowed' 
wasn't something this crowd gave much thought to.

As we entered the chamber proper we could finally take stock of the 
other attendees. As always the turnout was near capacity. No one 
dared miss an Angelo party lest their invitations stop coming but 
the guest list had a way of churning around anyway. This or that 
diplomatic envoy would arrive or leave, so-and-so's mother would 
fall out of favour with those who mattered. They were all dressed as 
the invitation had instructed, in the finest formal wear they could 
find, but something that a person could be buried in. Each reviler 
also wore a black masquerade mask with a skull painted on it. No 
doubt the painters and mask makers of the city had begun to wonder 
what event called for so many similar orders, but those who work 
with the privileged of Paris quickly learned that "Why?" was a 
question they did not like, no more that "No" was an answer they 
would accept.

Angelo wasn't hard to find, not that anyone would be easily 
identified in the sea of morbid outfits, all with similar faces 
(that was of course half of the fun) but that we was surrounded by a 
swirling swarm of people trying to "casually" have a conversation 
with him. Rather that head directly for his gravity well Trent and I 
made a circuit of the place to evaluate. The music was an odd 
combination of chamber music and electronic, which set a beat that 
was hardly danceable. Still, people moved rhythmically to it, as 
they flitted from one group to the next clutching the glasses 
distributed by the sharply dressed grim reapers who served as both 
bartender and waiter, serving black beers, bone white cocktails and 
more than a few drinks that were a deep, thick red.

Pairs of roisterer's would wander off into a side passage every once 
in a while to get some privacy, but the press in the room was still 
tight. Just because they would dress up as the dead didn't mean they 
particularly wanted to touch them.

The night moved on. Trent and I cycled between groups we knew while 
still taking care to speak to some new-comers in case one of them 
were actually important (they weren't). After 3 hours we started to 
notice that the chamber was emptying out. Not the quick 
disappearance of a party at its end but the slow trickle of an event 
that was moving to another location, be it the veranda, the attic or 
the lawn. I motioned for Trent to extricate himself from the group 
so that we could search out this fertile new land, and soon we were 
meandering the side passages which we expected to be populated by 
couples in various states of passion, but were only peopled by the 
Grim Reapers, gliding about with trays of drinks and empties.

Eventually we found a smaller side chamber where Angelo was holding 
court to a group of 20 or so of the more prominent attendees.

"Ah, Trent and Atherton!" he called "I asked Amelie to find you 
simply ages ago, the poor dear probably got lost on her way back" he 
turned now to one of the Reapers many Reapers that were milling 
about serving the guests "Could you be a dear and go find Amelie? 
She's the tall one with the chestnut hair wearing the stunning white 
dress." The Reaper nodded and made way down a passage leading back 
toward the party.

"Now Atherton, you simply must tell us how your dear mother is doing 
after that awful scare." The conversation was dry as always mostly 
consisting of blatantly feigned interest in the work or well-being 
of each-others parents in transparent attempts to pump each-other 
for information. What little talk didn't consist of attempted 
information gathering was primarily self congratulatory bragging 
attempting to mask itself as modesty and skill.

Just when I thought I could bear no more prattle and tittering 
someone I should have known but never bothered to learn the name of 
exclaimed "I say, the music has stopped, surely it can't be that 
late already." as she checked her watched exaggeratedly. Angelo 
checked his watch in earnest and replied "I told the man to keep the 
music going until the place was empty, and I'm sure that it can't 
have emptied already, I'll have to have words with him. Trent, 
Atherton, care to come along?" We extricated ourselves from the 
plush chairs which had been carted down by god know who and followed 
Angelo down the passage.

"To tell the truth these servers have been off all night, I don't 
know what's gotten in to them, I've used the same service in the 
past and never had a problem." "I did notice one of them holding a 
tray wrong." I offered. Angelo shock his head in disgust as we 
neared the main chamber. The music had certainly stopped, but the 
lights were still working "And here I thought they were classically 
trained, I'll have to have words if they've ruined the party."

A Reaper stepped out from the shadows with his mock in one hand as 
he held the other in front of him "I'm afraid ze time for words 'as 
past." He declared in a thick Parisian accent. "What the devil is 
the meaning of this, the service I called said they only employ 
Englishmen!" "Zat they do jeune homme, and a fine bunch of bellatre 
they were, but you've been getting your libations zis evening from 
ze Free French Forces."

"I'll have you know that my father is-" "Ze reason you're still 
breathing. Were your ransoms not the price of a free France I assure 
you that you would have drawn your last breath hours ago, for 
desecrating the graves of our comrades, even if it did neatly 
package all the jeune. But-" here the soldier brought the snath of 
his very solid scythe to meet Angelo's gut, knocking the wind from 
him and taking him to his knees "- one need only be alive to be 
ransomed, so that's enough talk from from you."
