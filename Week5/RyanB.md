We wandered around the old stone mines for half an hour before we finally found the actual Catacombs, and a further 15 minutes after that before we found the chamber where the event was being held. As we finally approached the music my flash-light was no longer the only source of light. Instead the reds, greens and blues of the party strobe played across the empty nose and endless stares of so many skulls. We were only saved from their grim smiles by the fact that most of the jaws had been removed and stored separately.

It had been Angelo's idea to have the party here. Ever the host, he made every one of his events more scandalous and thus of course desirable than the last. "Where shall we who can go where others can't have a party? Where NOONE can go." It was true that no one had been allowed into the tunnels since that child had gotten lost while doing a dare and starved to death some years ago, but 'allowed' wasn't something this crowd gave much thought to.

As we entered the chamber proper we could finally take stock of the other attendees. As always the turnout was near capacity. No one dared miss an Angelo party lest their invitations stop coming but the guest list had a way of churning around anyway. This or that diplomatic envoy would arrive or leave, so-and-so's mother would fall out of favour with those who mattered. They were all dressed as the invitation had instructed, in the finest formal wear they could find, but something that a person could be buried in. Each reviler also wore a black masquerade mask with a skull painted on it. No doubt the painters and mask makers of the city had begun to wonder what event called for so many similar orders, but those who work with the privileged of Paris quickly learned that "Why?" was a question they did not like, no more that "No" was an answer they would accept.

Angelo wasn't hard to find, not that anyone would be easily identified in the sea of morbid outfits, all with similar faces (that was of course half of the fun) but that we was surrounded by a swirling swarm of people trying to "casually" have a conversation with him. Rather that head directly for his gravity well Trent and I made a circuit of the place to evaluate. The music was an odd combination of chamber music and electronic, which set a beat that was hardly danceable. Still, people moved rhythmically to it, as they flitted from one group to the next clutching the glasses distributed by the sharply dressed grim reapers who served as both bartender and waiter, serving black beers, bone white cocktails and more than a few drinks that were a deep, thick red.

Pairs of roisterer's would wander off into a side passage every once in a while to get some privacy, but the press in the room was still tight. Just because they would dress up as the dead didn't mean they particularly wanted to touch them.

The night moved on. Trent and I cycled between groups we knew while still taking care to speak to some new-comers in case one of them were actually important (they weren't). After 3 hours we started to notice that the chamber was emptying out. Not the quick disappearance of a party at its end but the slow trickle of an event that was moving to another location, be it the veranda, the attic or the lawn. I motioned for Trent to extricate himself from the group so that we could search out this fertile new land, and soon we were meandering the side passages which we expected to be populated by couples in various states of passion, but were only peopled by the Grim Reapers, gliding about with trays of drinks and empties.

Eventually we found a smaller side chamber where Angelo was holding court to a group of 20 or so of the more prominent attendees.

"Ah, Trent and Atherton!" he called "I asked Amelie to find you simply ages ago, the poor dear probably got lost on her way back" he turned now to one of the Reapers many Reapers that were milling about serving the guests "Could you be a dear and go find Amelie? She's the tall one with the chestnut hair wearing the stunning white dress." The Reaper nodded and made way down a passage leading back toward the party.

"Now Atherton, you simply must tell us how your dear mother is doing after that awful scare." The conversation was dry as always mostly consisting of blatantly feigned interest in the work or well-being of each-others parents in transparent attempts to pump each-other for information. What little talk didn't consist of attempted information gathering was primarily self congratulatory bragging attempting to mask itself as modesty and skill.

Just when I thought I could bear no more prattle and tittering someone I should have known but never bothered to learn the name of exclaimed "I say, the music has stopped, surely it can't be that late already." as she checked her watched exaggeratedly. Angelo checked his watch in earnest and replied "I told the man to keep the music going until the place was empty, and I'm sure that it can't have emptied already, I'll have to have words with him. Trent, Atherton, care to come along?" We extricated ourselves from the plush chairs which had been carted down by god know who and followed Angelo down the passage.

"To tell the truth these servers have been off all night, I don't know what's gotten in to them, I've used the same service in the past and never had a problem." "I did notice one of them holding a tray wrong." I offered. Angelo shock his head in disgust as we neared the main chamber. The music had certainly stopped, but the lights were still working "And here I thought they were classically trained, I'll have to have words if they've ruined the party."

A Reaper stepped out from the shadows with his mock in one hand as he held the other in front of him "I'm afraid ze time for words 'as past." He declared in a thick Parisian accent. "What the devil is the meaning of this, the service I called said they only employ Englishmen!" "Zat they do jeune homme, and a fine bunch of bellatre they were, but you've been getting your libations zis evening from ze Free French Forces."

"I'll have you know that my father is-" "Ze reason you're still breathing. Were your ransoms not the price of a free France I assure you that you would have drawn your last breath hours ago, for desecrating the graves of our comrades, even if it did neatly package all the jeune. But-" here the soldier brought the snath of his very solid scythe to meet Angelo's gut, knocking the wind from him and taking him to his knees "- one need only be alive to be ransomed, so that's enough talk from from you."
