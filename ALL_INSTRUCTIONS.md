ALL INSTRUCTIONS

Formatting so that github likes it:
MS Office
1.	Click Save As
2.	Choose Plain Text under Save As Type
3.	When the next dialog pops up, make sure you click the checkbox next to "Insert Line Breaks"  
AND "Allow Character Substitution" After that you should be ready to put your file on Github.
Scrivener (recommended):
1.	Once you finish your story click the "Compile" button.
2.	In the "Format As" drop-down select "Plain Text Screenplay". It's not the prettiest , so if you 
find one you like better (or make a custom) please share!
3.	In the "Compile For" drop-down, select Plain Text (.txt). Make sure you include the extension!
4.	Compile and you should be ready to go.

So let's talk about getting your git set up on ye olde PC. 
1.	First, go to http://github.com . Make a free account. 
2.	Go to the repo link and hit fork (it's on the upper left side). You've now forked the repo!
3.	Now, go here:  http://windows.github.com/ and download the installer. It's only 37 MB...if 
you're watching your space.
4.	Login. You'll have to tell it  your name and email.
5.	You should be able to see the repo that you've forked "acq688/52WeekChallenge" when you 
click on your name. Go ahead and click the "Clone" link. 
6.	Once it loads, you should be able to see my information with all of the commits. If you click on 
Tools, and then "open Explorer", you can see everything in a normal Windows explorer. Go 
ahead and do this.
7.	Drag and drop your story into the proper week. So, put your eldritch adventure into Week1. 
Make sure that it's in a good file format, like I discussed in the other sample pull requests.
8.	Your Github GUI says "Uncommitted Changes" now. Click on Show.
9.	Is your story formatted well? Does everything look ok? If so, go ahead and write a commit 
message. Like, for example, "Amanda's Week 1 Story". When you're done, click commit.
10.	Notice that your new commit isn't synced. Go ahead and click the sync button. 
11.	This will add your file up to github. Unless you changed branches, it should be in your "master" 
branch. Go ahead and open a pull request and send it towards my master. Everyone will be 
able to see and comment on it there.

Opening A Pull Request (PR)
1.	Once you get your branch synced up, it should all be pretty straightforward, since you should 
be able to go to your own private fork and github should have noticed that you have a new 
commit and offer you the yellow pull request button. Click it
2.	Once you click it you can write comments/etc and send it. 
3.	If you run into problems here, let me know.
